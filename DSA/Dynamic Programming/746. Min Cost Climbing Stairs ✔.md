You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = [10,15,20]
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

### Explaination by GPT

The given problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. The intuition behind the approach is to calculate the minimum cost to reach each step from the bottom, considering the fact that we can either climb one or two steps at a time.

Let's define an array `dp` of the same length as the `cost` array. Each element `dp[i]` will represent the minimum cost to reach step `i` from the bottom. We need to find the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, which is equivalent to finding `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the `cost` array.

To reach step `i`, we have two options: either we came from step `i-1` or step `i-2`. We want to choose the option that minimizes the cost. Therefore, the recurrence relation to calculate `dp[i]` is as follows:

```java
dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
```

We initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` with the costs of the first and second steps, respectively, as they are the base cases. Then, we iterate from `i = 2` to `n-1`, updating `dp[i]` according to the recurrence relation.

Finally, the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor will be `min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])`, as we can start either from step 0 or step 1.

By using this dynamic programming approach, we can efficiently calculate the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, considering the given cost array and the option to climb one or two steps at a time.

```java
class Solution {

    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        // initialize the dp array
        int[] dp = new int[cost.length];
        // base cases 0 and 1 idx
        // we can start from 0 or 1
        dp[0] = cost[0];
        dp[1] = cost[1];
        // from step 2 onwards calculate the cost required to
        // reach the ith step using the formula
        // cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
        // we are choosing the minimum cost among
        // the i-1 and i-2
        // if we have to reach the 5th step we are
        // choosing the min costs b/w 3 and 4th steps
        // plus the cost of the 5th step(since we can only
        // climb the step if we pay the cost of the step)
        for(int i = 2; i < cost.length; i++){
            dp[i] = cost[i] + Math.min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]);
        }
        // to reach the top of the floor we can either come from
        // n-1 th step of n-2 th step
        return Math.min(dp[dp.length - 1], dp[dp.length - 2]);
    }
}
```

Yes, there is an optimization we can make to further improve the efficiency of solving this problem.

Instead of using an array `dp` of length `n`, we can use two variables to keep track of the minimum costs for the last two steps. Let's call these variables `prev1` and `prev2`.

Initially, we set `prev1` and `prev2` to the costs of the first and second steps, respectively. Then, we iterate from `i = 2` to `n-1`, updating `prev1` and `prev2` based on the recurrence relation:

```java
current = cost[i] + min(prev1, prev2)
prev2 = prev1
prev1 = current
```

After the loop, `prev1` will hold the minimum cost to reach the last step, and `prev2` will hold the minimum cost to reach the second-to-last step.

Finally, we return the minimum of `prev1` and `prev2` as the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

This optimization reduces the space complexity from O(n) to O(1) since we only need two variables to store the necessary information instead of an entire array. The time complexity remains O(n) as we still iterate through the cost array once.
